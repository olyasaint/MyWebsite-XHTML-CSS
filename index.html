	<h1><b>about us:</b> our goal</h1>
	<h2>Our Mission</h2>
	<p>
	"You are what you eat". This cliche is common, and there is hardly anyone who has not heard it.  
	Why is it true? Because it makes sense. Think about it: every 120 days or so, our body renews every single one of its cells and components.  
	Not one atom stays in our body longer than 120 days. The new atoms and components in our body come from the food we eat and the liquids we drink. 
	So if we drink and eat junk, our bodies will assimilate junk components inside, and we start to fall apart and suffer from health problems.  
	</p>
	<p>
	It's like a car, for example. If you drive a Toyota, would you use parts from a motorbike to repair your car, or would you buy original parts 
	made by Toyota for your car model? 
	<img src="images/aboutus_appleskiwis.jpg" class="illus" height="134" width="170" alt="green apples and kiwis" /> 
	Our body is made up of a composite of certain vital substances and parts, and we must use the "right spare parts" to maintain it.
	When you eat healthy, you gain the opportunity to realize your full potential: you feel healthy, think clearly, and live life to the fullest. 
	</p>
	<p>
	Raw Foodist is about showing you what it takes to maximize your life's potential, and guiding you to the <a href="products.htm" id="contentlinks">resources</a> you need
	to stay safe and healthy in today's complex, toxic, and stressful environment.
	Raw Foodist is not just about preparing raw, live food. It is also an opportunity to discover what it's like to be fully alive. We'll share the tips and secrets 
	that make transitioning to a raw food way of life easier and more convenient. Our tips will help you avoid making mistakes and to overcome "the bumps along the road".  
	</p>
	<p>
	As someone who consumed only raw food for years, I understand how much there is to learn (and unlearn!) in order to simplify diet. Ever see a wild animal consulting a nutrition manual?  
	This is about discovering a simple way to a lifestyle that gives you delicious meals and perfect health. You will gain knowledge that will set you free from the traditional way of thinking about food and health. 
	And once you experience it, you will wonder how you ever lived without it! At Raw Foodist, you'll get the support, encouragement, and inspiration from a group of like-minded people. 
	Together, we can create a new age of superior eating habits and healthy living, to serve as our legacy for generations to come.
